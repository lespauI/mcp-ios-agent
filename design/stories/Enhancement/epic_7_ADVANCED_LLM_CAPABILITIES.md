   - Estimated effort: 13 story points

2. **Multi-Step Reasoning**
   - Implement chain-of-thought planning
   - Create branching decision trees
   - Build backtracking for failed strategies
   - Estimated effort: 13 story points

3. **Advanced Prompt Engineering**
   - Implement dynamic prompt construction
   - Create context-aware instruction generation
   - Build prompt optimization based on outcomes
   - Estimated effort: 8 story points

4. **Sophisticated Caching**
   - Implement semantic similarity for cache matching
   - Create context-aware cache invalidation
   - Build partial response reuse
   - Estimated effort: 8 story points

5. **Failure Analysis & Recovery**
