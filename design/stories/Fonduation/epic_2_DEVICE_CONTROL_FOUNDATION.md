# MCP-Based iOS Testing Framework: Development Epics & Stories

## FOUNDATION PHASE

### EPIC 2: DEVICE CONTROL FOUNDATION

**Description**: Create the layer that connects MCP tools to actual iOS device actions.

**Architecture Overview**:
The Device Control layer acts as the bridge between MCP tool calls and actual iOS device operations. It abstracts the complexity of Appium/WebDriver interactions, providing a reliable and consistent interface for device manipulation while handling synchronization, error recovery, and state tracking.

**Technology Stack**:
- Appium Client: Python-based WebDriver client with iOS-specific extensions
- Device Communication: WebDriverAgent for iOS device control
- Element Identification: Multi-strategy selector system with fallbacks
- State Management: In-memory caching with Redis integration
- Error Handling: Categorized exception system with recovery strategies
- Visual Processing: OpenCV for image-based operations

**Stories**:

1. **Appium Integration Base**
   - Establish connection to Appium server
     - Implement connection pool with configurable size and timeout
     - Create retry mechanisms for transient connection failures
     - Implement event listeners for Appium server events
     - Set up logging and diagnostics for connection issues
   - Implement basic session management
     - Design session factory with configurable capabilities
     - Create session reuse strategies to minimize startup time
     - Implement session health checks and recovery
     - Build session metadata tracking for analytics
   - Create device capability configuration
     - Implement device profiles for different iOS versions/devices
     - Create dynamic capability adjustment based on test requirements
     - Build environment-aware capability selection
     - Implement capability validation and normalization
   - Estimated effort: 5 story points
   - **Technical guidance**: Implement connection pooling to reduce session creation overhead. Use a factory pattern for session creation with dependency injection for testing. Create an abstraction layer above the raw Appium client to simplify higher-level operations.

2. **Element Location System**
   - Implement XPath-based element finding
     - Create optimized XPath generation for common UI patterns
     - Implement XPath result filtering and ranking
     - Build retry logic with progressive waits
     - Create XPath template system for common element patterns
   - Create accessibility ID locator strategy
     - Implement primary accessibility ID-based location
     - Create fallback chains for when accessibility IDs are missing
     - Build predictive accessibility ID inference
     - Implement ID stabilization for dynamic UIs
   - Build element caching mechanism
     - Create time-based and action-based cache invalidation
     - Implement element reference tracking and garbage collection
     - Build hierarchical caching with parent-child relationships
     - Create cache preloading for anticipated interactions
   - Estimated effort: 8 story points
   - **Technical guidance**: Design the element location system as a pipeline with strategies tried in order of reliability and performance. Cache elements with a smart invalidation strategy that understands when UI actions would make cached elements stale. Implement robust error handling with appropriate retries.

3. **Core UI Actions**
   - Implement tap/click actions
     - Create precision tap with configurable duration
     - Implement multi-tap sequence support
     - Build tap verification with visual confirmation option
     - Create force touch/3D touch simulation
   - Create text input functionality
     - Implement secure text field handling
     - Create keyboard detection and management
     - Build input verification and retry logic
     - Implement clipboard operations
   - Build swipe/scroll capabilities
     - Create directional and element-targeted swiping
     - Implement momentum scrolling with variable speed
     - Build edge detection and boundary handling
     - Create scroll-until-visible functionality
   - Estimated effort: 5 story points
   - **Technical guidance**: Implement each UI action with appropriate pre-checks to ensure the target element is actionable. Include post-action verification to confirm the intended effect. Handle iOS-specific behaviors like keyboard appearance/dismissal automatically.

4. **App Control Actions**
   - Implement app launch/terminate
     - Create configurable launch with arguments and environment
     - Implement deep link support for specific app states
     - Build launch verification with timeout and retry
     - Create clean termination with state preservation option
   - Create app reset functionality
     - Implement data reset without app reinstall
     - Create full reset with app reinstall
     - Build selective state reset (user data, preferences, etc.)
     - Implement reset verification
   - Build app state verification
     - Create foreground/background state detection
     - Implement app identity verification
     - Build app responsiveness checks
     - Create app crash detection and recovery
   - Estimated effort: 3 story points
   - **Technical guidance**: Use Appium's app management capabilities but add verification and resilience layers. Create a clean separation between app lifecycle operations and in-app interactions. Implement robust logging to capture app state transitions.

5. **UI State Capture**
   - Implement screenshot capture
     - Create non-blocking screenshot capture
     - Implement configurable resolution and quality
     - Build metadata annotation (timestamp, session info)
     - Create automatic naming and organization
   - Create XML hierarchy extraction
     - Implement efficient page source retrieval
     - Create XML cleaning and normalization

     - Create property comparison for state verification
   - Estimated effort: 5 story points
   - **Technical guidance**: Optimize state capture for performance, especially XML hierarchy extraction which can be slow. Implement smart caching of UI state with invalidation on UI actions. Design the state capture system to work asynchronously when possible to avoid blocking test execution.

6. **Synchronization Framework**
   - Implement intelligent waiting strategies
     - Create condition-based waiting primitives
     - Implement wait for element visibility/invisibility
     - Build wait for attribute/property conditions
     - Create custom predicate-based waiting

     - Create dynamic timeout adjustment based on device performance
     - Build timeout profiles for different test scenarios
     - Implement timeout monitoring and alerting
   - Build element presence/absence verification
     - Create reliable element existence checks with timeouts
     - Implement negative assertions with appropriate waits
     - Build element state verification (enabled, selected, etc.)
     - Create multi-element condition verification
   - Estimated effort: 8 story points
   - **Technical guidance**: Design the synchronization framework to be the foundation of reliable testing. Implement both implicit and explicit waiting strategies. Use progressive backoff for retries. Create a flexible condition system that can combine multiple criteria (element state, UI state, etc.).

**Integration Considerations**:
- The Device Control layer will expose a clean API to the MCP server, abstracting Appium complexity
- Operations should be atomic and idempotent where possible
- Create a comprehensive error classification system that maps device/Appium errors to meaningful MCP responses
- Implement detailed logging that can be correlated with MCP server logs using shared request IDs

**Performance Requirements**:
- UI actions should complete within 5 seconds or return appropriate timeout errors
- Element location strategies should be prioritized by speed (accessibility ID first, XPath as fallback)
- Screenshot capture should not block UI interactions
- Connection establishment to device should take no more than 30 seconds, including Appium startup

**Reliability Requirements**:
- Implement automatic recovery for common failure scenarios (device disconnection, app crash)
- Create health monitoring to detect device state degradation
- Develop circuit breaker pattern for unreliable operations
- Implement session isolation to prevent cross-test interference

**Environment Setup Requirements**:
- Support both local iOS simulators and physical devices
- Create comprehensive device setup documentation
- Implement environment verification tools to validate Appium and iOS setup
- Support cloud device farms (Sauce Labs, BrowserStack, etc.) through configuration
