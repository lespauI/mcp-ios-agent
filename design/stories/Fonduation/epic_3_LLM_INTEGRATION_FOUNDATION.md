# MCP-Based iOS Testing Framework: Development Epics & Stories

## FOUNDATION PHASE

### EPIC 3: LLM INTEGRATION FOUNDATION

**Description**: Build the components that allow LLMs to interpret and control the testing process.

**Architecture Overview**:
The LLM Integration layer serves as the intelligence hub of the system, enabling AI models to understand app state, make decisions, and drive testing actions through the MCP protocol. This layer connects to LLM providers, manages context, interprets responses, and translates them into concrete testing operations.

**Technology Stack**:
- MCP Client: Python-based async client with SSE support
- LLM Integration: Multi-provider abstraction supporting Claude, GPT-4, and others
- Context Management: Vector database for semantic similarity and retrieval
- Response Parsing: Structured output handling with graceful error recovery
- Caching: Two-level cache with semantic deduplication
- State Tracking: Incremental state updates with delta encoding

For parameter validation, use JSON Schema with extensions for iOS-specific value constraints. Create a planning system that can reason about operation dependencies.

**Integration Considerations**:
- LLM Interface Layer must be designed to work with multiple LLM providers through a consistent API
- All context management should optimize for token efficiency while maintaining critical information
- Implement detailed instrumentation to track LLM performance, latency, and cost metrics
- Create a feedback loop where test outcomes inform future tool selection decisions

**Performance Requirements**:
- LLM response processing should add minimal overhead (<500ms)
- Context assembly should be optimized to minimize token usage while preserving critical information
- Caching system should achieve at least 30% hit rate for common testing scenarios
- Tool selection should prioritize efficient paths to test goals based on learned patterns

**Security Considerations**:
- Implement PII detection and redaction in context sent to external LLM providers
- Create audit logging for all LLM requests and responses
- Set up configurable content filtering for generated actions
- Establish rate limits and usage monitoring to prevent abuse

**Evaluation Metrics**:
- Decision quality: % of LLM decisions that lead to successful test steps
- Context efficiency: Average tokens per request while maintaining decision quality
- Response parsing reliability: % of responses successfully parsed into structured actions
- Recovery effectiveness: % of error cases where automatic recovery succeeds
