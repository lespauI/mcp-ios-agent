# MCP-Based iOS Testing Framework: Development Epics & Stories

## FOUNDATION PHASE

### EPIC 1: MCP SERVER INFRASTRUCTURE

**Description**: Establish the core MCP server foundation that will handle communication between LLM agents and iOS devices.

**Architecture Overview**:
The MCP server will act as the critical intermediary between LLM agents and iOS devices. It must implement the Model-Context Protocol specification to enable standardized communication, while also providing robust infrastructure for testing operations.

**Technology Stack**:
- Server Framework: FastAPI (Python) for high performance and async support
- Transport Layer: HTTP+SSE with WebSockets fallback option
- Message Format: JSON-RPC 2.0
- Database: Redis for session storage and caching
- Authentication: JWT-based with API key validation
- Containerization: Docker for deployment consistency

**Stories**:

1. **Basic MCP Server Setup** ✅
   **Status: Completed**
   - Implement HTTP+SSE transport layer
     - Create FastAPI application structure with dedicated routers for MCP endpoints
     - Implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) channel for real-time updates to clients
     - Set up JSON-RPC message parser and validator
     - Ensure proper error handling with standardized MCP error responses
   - Configure JSON-RPC message handling
     - Create middleware for validating JSON-RPC 2.0 message structure
     - Implement request/response pipeline with proper message ID tracking
     - Set up notification support for one-way messages
   - Establish server lifecycle management
     - Implement graceful startup/shutdown procedures
     - Create health check endpoints
     - Set up connection keepalive and timeout mechanisms
   - Estimated effort: 3 story points
   - **Technical guidance**: Utilize FastAPI's dependency injection for modular components. Structure code to separate transport concerns (HTTP/SSE handling) from MCP protocol logic. Follow the MCP specification for message formats exactly.

2. **Tool Registry Implementation** ✅
   **Status: Completed**
   - Create schema validation system for tools
     - Implement JSON Schema validation for tool definitions
     - Build schema registry with versioning support
     - Create validation pipeline for incoming tool calls
   - Implement tool registration mechanism
     - Develop decorator-based tool registration system (@register_tool)
     - Implement dynamic tool discovery from modules
     - Create tool metadata storage with description and parameter requirements
   - Build tool discovery API
     - Implement list_tools endpoint following MCP specification
     - Create filtering and categorization capabilities
     - Ensure proper documentation is exposed through the API
   - Estimated effort: 5 story points
   - **Technical guidance**: Design the tool registry as a pluggable system where new tools can be registered at runtime. Use Pydantic for schema validation. Implement a factory pattern for tool instantiation to allow for dependency injection and testing.

3. **Resource Manager Foundation** ✅
   **Status: Completed**
   - Implement resource URI scheme
     - Design URI format that uniquely identifies resources (screenshots, XMLs, etc.)
     - Implement URI parser and validator
     - Create resource referencing system for MCP responses
   - Create resource storage and retrieval system
     - Implement pluggable storage backends (local filesystem, S3-compatible)
     - Develop efficient blob storage with content-addressable features
     - Set up resource streaming for large assets
   - Build resource metadata tracking
     - Create metadata schema for different resource types
     - Implement tagging system for resources
     - Set up TTL and garbage collection for temporary resources
   - Estimated effort: 5 story points
   - **Technical guidance**: Use content-based addressing (e.g., hash of content) as part of the URI scheme to avoid duplicates. Implement the storage layer with an interface abstraction to allow switching between local and cloud storage. For metadata, consider a hybrid approach with a fast in-memory index backed by persistent storage.

4. **Session Management** ✅
   **Status: Completed**
   - Implement session creation/destruction
     - Design session initialization protocol
     - Create unique session identifiers with cryptographic security
     - Implement session cleanup and resource release
   - Create context persistence within session
     - Build state management system for maintaining test context
     - Implement hierarchical context storage (global/session/operation)
     - Create context snapshot and restoration capabilities
   - Build session timeout and renewal mechanisms
     - Implement configurable idle timeout detection
     - Create session heartbeat mechanism
     - Develop session renewal protocol that preserves context
   - Estimated effort: 3 story points
   - **Technical guidance**: Use Redis for session storage to enable horizontal scaling. Design sessions to be self-contained and isolate resources between sessions. Implement proper locking mechanisms to handle concurrent operations within a session.

5. **Authentication & Security Layer** ✅
   **Status: Completed**
   - Implement API key validation
     - Create API key generation and management system
     - Implement rate limiting based on API key
     - Set up key rotation capabilities
   - Create permission-based access controls
     - Design role-based access control (RBAC) system
     - Implement tool-level permission checks
     - Create resource access permission model
   - Set up secure communication channels
     - Enforce HTTPS with proper certificate management
     - Implement request signing for tool calls
     - Create audit logging for sensitive operations
   - Estimated effort: 8 story points
   - **Technical guidance**: Use JWT for stateless authentication with short expiration times. For API keys, implement a multi-tier approach with master keys and session-specific keys. Store sensitive credentials using appropriate encryption. Consider implementing OAuth2 for future integration with SSO systems.

6. **Telemetry Framework** ✅
   **Status: Completed**
   - Create structured logging system
     - Implement contextual logging with correlation IDs
     - Set up log levels and filtering capabilities
     - Create log aggregation mechanism
   - Implement operation tracking
     - Design trace context propagation
     - Build operation timing and performance tracking
     - Create dependency tracking between operations
   - Build performance metrics collection
     - Implement Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoints
     - Create custom metrics for MCP operations
     - Set up alerting thresholds for performance degradation
   - Estimated effort: 3 story points
   - **Technical guidance**: Use OpenTelemetry for standardized observability. Design the telemetry system to be non-blocking to avoid performance impact. Implement sampling strategies for high-volume environments. Consider privacy implications when logging tool parameters and results.

**Integration Considerations**:
- The MCP server should be designed to run independently of the LLM agent, communicating only through the MCP protocol.
- All components should be containerized for consistent deployment across environments.
- Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests to verify MCP specification compliance.
- Design with horizontal scaling in mind, particularly for session management and resource handling.

**Performance Requirements**:
- Server should handle at least 100 concurrent sessions
- Tool execution response time should be under 200ms (excluding actual tool operation time)
- SSE connection should maintain stability for at least 4 hours of continuous operation
- Resource retrieval should support streaming for assets larger than 10MB

**Deployment Strategy**:
- Initial deployment as a single container with Docker Compose
- Evolution to Kubernetes for production scaling
- Support for cloud-managed services (AWS ECS, Azure Container Apps) as deployment targets
