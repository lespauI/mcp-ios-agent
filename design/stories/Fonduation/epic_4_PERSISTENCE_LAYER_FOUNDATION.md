# MCP-Based iOS Testing Framework: Development Epics & Stories

## FOUNDATION PHASE

### EPIC 4: PERSISTENCE LAYER FOUNDATION

**Description**: Create the data storage infrastructure necessary for test history and knowledge management.

**Architecture Overview**:
The Persistence Layer serves as the system's memory and knowledge repository, storing all test artifacts, results, and contextual information. It provides a scalable and queryable foundation for historical analysis, knowledge retrieval, and test case management, using both document-based and vector storage systems.

**Technology Stack**:
- Primary Database: MongoDB for document storage and flexible schemas
- Vector Database: Pinecone/Weaviate for semantic search capabilities
- Blob Storage: S3-compatible object storage for binary assets
- Caching Layer: Redis for high-speed data access
- Query Engine: MongoDB Aggregation Framework with optimized indexes
- Data Model: Event-sourced architecture with immutable test records

**Stories**:

1. **Database Infrastructure**
   - Set up MongoDB/document database
     - Implement replica set configuration for high availability
     - Create database initialization scripts with validation rules
     - Set up automated backup procedures
     - Configure security policies and access controls
   - Implement connection pooling
     - Build configurable connection pool with health monitoring
     - Create connection lifecycle management with graceful handling
     - Implement retry strategies for transient failures
     - Build connection metrics for performance monitoring
   - Create index optimization
     - Design compound indexes for common query patterns
     - Implement time-to-live indexes for ephemeral data
     - Set up background index creation and maintenance
     - Create index usage analytics for optimization
   - Estimated effort: 3 story points
   - **Technical guidance**: Use MongoDB Atlas for managed database or deploy a self-hosted replica set with at least 3 nodes. Implement connection pooling using the official MongoDB driver with minimum 10, maximum 100 connections. Create indexes for all query patterns but balance with write performance. Use MongoDB Compass to analyze query performance. Implement automated migrations for schema changes.

2. **Test Results Storage**
   - Implement test run schema
     - Design hierarchical schema (test suite > test case > test step)
     - Create versioning system for test definitions
     - Build result classification taxonomy
     - Implement metadata schema for test context (device, OS, app version)
   - Create CRUD operations for test results
     - Implement atomic write operations with optimistic concurrency
     - Create bulk operations for batch result processing
     - Build partial update operations for long-running tests
     - Implement soft deletion with retention policies
   - Build query optimization for result retrieval
     - Create materialized views for common report types
     - Implement pagination with efficient cursor-based design
     - Build faceted search for multi-dimensional filtering
     - Create result aggregation pipelines for analytics
   - Estimated effort: 5 story points
   - **Technical guidance**: Design the schema with an event-sourced pattern where test actions and results are recorded as a stream of immutable events. Use MongoDB's document model to store the complete test execution context with each result. Implement custom serialization for large result sets. Create specialized indexes for common query patterns like date ranges, test status, and feature area.

3. **Asset Management**
   - Implement blob storage for screenshots
     - Create abstraction layer supporting multiple backends (S3, Azure, etc.)
     - Implement content-addressed storage for deduplication
     - Build chunked upload for large assets
     - Create retention policies with lifecycle rules
   - Create asset versioning system
     - Implement immutable asset storage with version tracking
     - Build diff generation for visual comparison
     - Create asset relationship tracking
     - Implement version pruning for storage optimization
   - Build asset metadata indexing
     - Create searchable metadata schema for assets
     - Implement tagging system for categorization
     - Build content extraction for searchable text
     - Create association mapping between assets and test runs
   - Estimated effort: 5 story points
   - **Technical guidance**: Use S3-compatible storage with a tiered approach - recent assets in hot storage, older assets in cold storage. Implement content-based addressing to avoid duplicates (store hash of image content). For screenshots, store both full resolution and thumbnails. Include EXIF-like metadata with each asset (resolution, format, etc.). Create a separate database collection for asset metadata with references to the binary storage.

4. **Knowledge Base Schema**
   - Design application context schema
     - Create flexible schema for app specifications
     - Implement hierarchical feature representation
     - Build requirement traceability matrix
     - Create domain-specific vocabulary mapping
   - Create test case repository structure
     - Implement categorization taxonomy
     - Build parameterization schema for test variants
     - Create prerequisite and dependency tracking
     - Implement coverage mapping to requirements
   - Build relationships between knowledge entities
     - Create graph representation of entity relationships
     - Implement bidirectional link validation
     - Build semantic relationship classification
     - Create integrity constraints for relationship consistency
   - Estimated effort: 8 story points
   - **Technical guidance**: Design a graph-oriented schema in MongoDB that represents application features, test cases, and their relationships. Use embedded documents for closely related concepts and references for loosely coupled entities. Create a comprehensive schema validation to ensure data integrity. Implement a tagging system that allows cross-cutting concerns to be represented. Consider using a specialized graph database as a future enhancement for complex relationship queries.

5. **Vector Database Integration**
   - Set up vector database (Pinecone/Weaviate)
     - Implement connection management with failover
     - Create namespace organization for different embedding types
     - Build index optimization for various vector dimensions
     - Implement access control and security policies
   - Implement embedding generation
     - Create text embedding pipeline using modern models

     - Implement multi-modal search capability
     - Build hybrid search combining vector and keyword
     - Create relevance scoring and ranking
     - Implement query expansion for improved results
   - Estimated effort: 8 story points
   - **Technical guidance**: Use Pinecone for production deployments due to its managed scaling capabilities, but consider Weaviate for projects that need more flexibility. Generate embeddings using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 or similar models with 1536 dimensions. Implement caching of embedding requests to reduce API costs. Create a synchronization service that keeps MongoDB and the vector database in sync. Design the search API to support both exact and semantic matching with configurable thresholds.

6. **Test Scenario Persistence**
   - Implement step sequence storage
     - Create serializable action schema

     - Create variation selection strategies
   - Estimated effort: 5 story points
   - **Technical guidance**: Design test scenarios as composable, reusable units that can be parameterized. Implement a DSL (Domain Specific Language) for defining test flows that is both machine and human readable. Store scenarios in a format that supports versioning and inheritance (child scenarios can extend parent scenarios). Use JSON Schema for validation of scenarios. Implement a template engine that can substitute variables and control structures in scenarios.

**Integration Considerations**:
- Design the persistence layer to be accessed through a clean repository pattern API
- Implement robust error handling and data validation at the persistence layer
- Create comprehensive logging for all database operations for debugging and audit

- Support for storing at least 100,000 test runs with full history
- Ability to handle at least 100 concurrent write operations
- Support for at least 10TB of binary assets with efficient retrieval

**Scalability Considerations**:
- Implement horizontal scaling for MongoDB with sharding for large deployments
- Design the schema to avoid unbounded array growth in documents
- Create a time-based partitioning strategy for historical data
- Implement a data archiving strategy for old test results

**Security Requirements**:
- Encrypt all sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Implement row-level security for multi-tenant deployments
